Practice with some dictionaries

This simple program takes a csv file of data and puts it into a dictionary.

The dictionary is then assessed against the dictionary in the script to see 
if the entry exists. 

If the entry doesn't exist, a new one is created with the data.

If the entry does exist then the data in the csv file is added to the 
dictionary.
